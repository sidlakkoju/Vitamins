# Vitamins
Hey! Vitamins is a Medication reminders app that allows users to keep track of their Vitamins and Medications and schedule daily reminders to take them. 
The app features a seemless and modern UI made using SwiftUI with big and bold UI icons to allow for user friendliness.

The Demo shown bellow shows an older build of Vitmins. The UI has been refined featuring a much easier to use time picker. The video will update very soon to reflect these changes!
